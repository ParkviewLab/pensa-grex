# In-flight ideas

Scratchpad for ideas under consideration. Each entry is a question, not a
commitment — see the handbook's `documentation.md`.

## Design studies (open in a browser)

- [`subway-forest-themed.html`](subway-forest-themed.html) — the current working
  prototype: the subway grammar with the atomic-age skin on a cool ground, a
  ground toggle (azure / navy), branches joining at junctions between tasks,
  left/right alternation, and labels centered below stations.
- [`subway-forest.html`](subway-forest.html) — the first subway prototype
  (black-and-white, labels to the right, forks at stations). Superseded by the
  themed version above for layout; kept as the plain-grammar reference.
- [`model_ideas.md`](model_ideas.md) — accumulated model and interaction
  decisions (the push/pop meaning of "stack", entities, the settled layout
  rules, open questions). Feeds the data model and a future northstar.
- [`tree-grammars.html`](tree-grammars.html) — the original ten black-and-white
  layout grammars for the task tree (five horizontal, five vertical), one shared
  skin, the same sample forest in each. Subway (grammar 3) was chosen.
- [`theme_ideas.md`](theme_ideas.md) — the Googie / atomic-age / mid-century
  visual direction, held for the theming stage (skin comes after the grammar
  and data model).

# 1. Project intent (`docs/northstar.md`)

The repo was bootstrapped from the ParkviewLab handbook conventions before
the app's actual purpose was written down. `docs/northstar.md` is optional
but valuable once the intent is clear — worth writing as soon as
TaskForkStack's shape settles.

# 2. Deferred: in-app license-notices viewer

The handbook's `electron-tooling.md` describes a generated `legal/` bundle
(`scripts/prepare-legal.mjs`, a `Help → Open Source Licenses` window) that
ships third-party notices with a packaged build. Skipped at bootstrap since
there are no dependencies yet worth notarizing. Worth adding once real
dependencies accumulate — conception-space is the reference implementation.

# 3. Deferred: code signing

`electron-builder.yml` ships unsigned (macOS Gatekeeper / Windows SmartScreen
will warn on first launch). Signing needs a Developer ID cert + notarization
credentials (mac) and a code-signing cert (win) wired into
`.github/workflows/release-electron.yml` as repo secrets — worth doing before
a first public release, not before.

# 4. `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` repo secret

The changelog job's Highlights paragraph needs `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`. Unlike a
ParkviewLab-org repo, this one doesn't inherit an org-level secret — it needs
its own repo secret (`gh secret set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`). The script degrades
gracefully without it (placeholder text, release still ships), so this isn't
blocking, just worth doing before the first real release.
